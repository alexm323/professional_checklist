1. Crafting your story:
 I thought my job as a Dealer was secure until the casinos in Los Angeles closed down due to the pandemic. I swore that day that I would never be in that position again and so I began my foray intro programming. I'm a member of the 100Devs team and a graduate of the Springboard Software Engineering Course. I am passionate about learning and building my skills and am currently learning about React Native and working on my first mobile app.
